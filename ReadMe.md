**OntologyGen** is a web-based software tool built with Python and Django, designed for the automated generation of OWL ontologies from MongoDB databases using **Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)**. It provides a seamless workflow for extracting structured knowledge from NoSQL databases, simplifying ontology engineering through an interactive web interface.

## Software Architecture

![Architecture Diagram Placeholder](https://github.com/Med-Gon/OntologyGen-phd/assets/architecture_diagram.png)

The OntologyGen application is structured as a **Django-based web app** with a clean separation between the **backend** (handling FCA, data processing, and ontology generation) and the **frontend** (managing user interactions and data visualization). It uses **MongoDB** as the primary data source and integrates FCA algorithms for concept lattice generation.

### Key Components

1. **MongoDB Integration:** Data source for ontology generation.
2. **Django Backend:** Handles context extraction, lattice generation, and OWL mapping.
3. **Interactive Frontend:** User-friendly web interface for data import, lattice visualization, and ontology export.
4. **Docker Containerization:** Simplifies deployment and setup.

## Docker Image

The Docker setup for OntologyGen includes both the backend (Django server) and the MongoDB database for easy local deployment.

### Docker Compose Configuration

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:latest
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - ./data/db:/data/db

  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=ontologygen.settings
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
```

To start the Docker environment, run:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

---

## Backend (Django)

### Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Django 4.2+**
- **PyMongo**
- **Docker**

### Key Features

- Automated context extraction from MongoDB collections.
- Concept lattice generation using FCA.
- Ontology class and property mapping.
- OWL file export.

---

## Frontend

### Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Bootstrap (for responsive design)**

### Frontend Project Structure

The frontend is built using Django templates for seamless integration with the backend logic.

- **Templates:** HTML pages for each step in the ontology generation process.
- **Static Files:** CSS for styling and JavaScript for dynamic interactions.
- **User Interface:** Clean, minimal design with step-by-step navigation.
